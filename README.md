# Customer Churn Prediction

A machine learning project to predict customer churn based on historical data and interactions.

## Objective

Develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn).

## Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Data Processing**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras
  - **Model Evaluation**: Scikit-learn (cross-validation, metrics)

## Project Structure

- `CUSTOMER CHURN.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the project code and analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for the project.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Open and run the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook CUSTOMER CHURN.ipynb
    ```
